linked lists are a linear data structure, where the elements are not stored in a contegious memory allocation.
the elements of a linked list consiste of a node containing the data stored and a pointer to next node.
the first node of a linked list is called HEAD, while the last one is called TAIL ( the TAIL points to a NULL).
Linked lists are a better choice than arrays when it comes to mutating the data by adding or deleting an element of the linked list.
